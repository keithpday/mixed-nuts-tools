{t:This Land Is Your Land}{st:Woody Guthrie}This land is [C]your land, this land is [G]my land   (CHORUS)From Cali-[D7]fornia, to the New York [G]IslandFrom the redwood [C]forest, to the Gulf stream [G]waters[D7]This land was made for you and [G]meAs I was walk[C]ing a ribbon of highway [G]I saw abov[D7]e me an endless skyway  [G]I saw bel[C]ow me a golden valley      [G][D7]This land was made for you and [G]me   (Sing Chorus)I roamed and rambled, and followed my footstepsThrough the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts,And all around me this voice kept saying,"This land was made for you and me."       (Sing Chorus) As the Sun was shining, and I was strollingThrough the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling,I could feel inside me and see all around me,This land was made for you and me.       (Sing Chorus two times to end)
